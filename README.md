# CDAB Simple Plugin

Welcome to the CDAB Simple Plugin repository. This plugin is designed as a lightweight, web-based interface to facilitate the benchmarking of various data providers using the [Copernicus Sentinels Data Access Worldwide Benchmark Test Suite](https://github.com/esacdab/cdab-testsuite/wiki). Our primary focus with this simple plugin is to perform tests for the [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/).

## Background

The [Copernicus Sentinels Data Access Worldwide Benchmark Test Suite](https://github.com/esacdab/cdab-testsuite/wiki) is an essential software tool used to run Test Scenarios for benchmarking various providers. Understanding the functioning of this test suite is crucial for our project. To achieve a quicker execution of these test scenarios, we have opted for a web-based interface where results can be triggered at the click of a button.

This public repository is dedicated to explaining and showcasing the codes used to operate this web-based interface efficiently.

## Test Scenarios

The chosen Test Scenarios for this plugin are **TS01** and **TS02**. These scenarios have been selected because they are the fastest, allowing us to test the download speeds of the site based on the different locations of the user's computer.

For a detailed description of these Test Scenarios, please visit the following link: [Test Scenarios Description](https://github.com/esacdab/cdab-testsuite/wiki/Test-Scenarios-Description).

## How It Works

To discover how this plugin operates, please click on **[Start the Plugin](#)**. This link will guide you to a detailed wiki page explaining the step-by-step process of our testing tool.

## Why a Web-Based Interface?

The decision to develop a web-based interface was driven by the need for speed and efficiency in running Test Scenarios. This interface allows for quick setup, execution, and visualization of results, optimizing the benchmarking process.
